          <li>
            <strong>Document Chunking Process:</strong> The document library,
            which holds various documents, undergoes a chunking process. This
            means that each document is divided into smaller sections to
            facilitate more precise analysis and retrieval.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embedding Creation with Azure OpenAI Service:</strong> Each
            chunk (or section) of a document is processed by the Azure OpenAI
            Service using a model called &quot;text-embedding-3-large&quot;.
            This step creates numerical representations called embeddings, which
            capture the semantic meaning of each section. The chunked data along
            with their embeddings are then stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Indexing in Azure AI Search Vector Index:</strong> The
            embeddings for all the document sections are indexed in the Azure AI
            Search Vector Index. This vector index helps in efficiently finding
            the most relevant document chunks when a user query is received.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Interaction and Question Handling:</strong> When a user
            submits a question, it goes through the Azure OpenAI Service to
            create an embedded representation of the question. The embedding is
            used to match and retrieve the relevant document sections from the
            vector index.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Answer Generation:</strong> The retrieved relevant document
            sections are combined into a prompt, which is then processed by
            another model (such as GPT-4.0) to generate a comprehensive response
            to the user&apos;s question. This response can include not only
            direct answers but also other NLP tasks, such as summarization or
            further explanations.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Document Search:</strong> Users can ask
            questions about the documents, and the chatbot will provide answers
            derived directly from the document content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> By leveraging Azure AI Verctor
            Search, the solution minimizes resource-intensive operations by
            targeting specific and relevant content rather than analyzing entire
            documents. This targeted approach significantly reduces
            computational costs, ensuring a budget-friendly implementation
            without compromising performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficient Data Retrieval:</strong> The embedding-based
            approach ensures that only the most relevant portions of documents
            are analyzed for each question, providing quick and accurate
            responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced AI Technology:</strong> The system leverages Azure
            OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search to deliver high-quality,
            context-aware responses, making it suitable for a variety of
            applications like customer service, research assistance, and
            internal documentation analysis.
